# Reason for doing this...
Me and my friend are new to programming and wanted to make a weather app.. Sounds easy right if you know some javascript fetch or ascyn, html and css..
The problem we ran into was that we couldn't hide my friends API key in the front end.. 

## sheeesh
The problem got escalated and we've been working on this for weeks... Just hiding an API key.. But now we have a solution that is kind of working... The api key is hidden, but there is one thing that i wont mention that could expose the object that comes from the API. 

###
So what now? Now is the coordinates from the html5 coordinates api sent from the front end to the backend, which is good.. But I have to store the coordinates in a database, and i think if we always get the latest coordinates from the database we'll always point it to the right user... We will see..

I think i will leave this here for now, but in the future i might look into things again, for example maybe updating the Coordinates in the database instead of storing every single one.
